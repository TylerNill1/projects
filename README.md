In this repository, it shows the projects I worked on during my senior astronomy laboratory course, which includes confirming the existence of an exoplanet.

The projects are separated into their respective folders, which show the necessary markdown code and the reports for each one. 

I also included my final astronomy major paper that goes into detail about the observational evidences for dark matter.
