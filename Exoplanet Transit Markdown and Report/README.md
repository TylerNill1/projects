In this folder are three items: Exoplanet Transit Jupyter Notebook, Exoplanet Transit Markdown, and Exoplanet Transit Report. The Jupyter Notebook and Markdown are very similar; however, GitHub failed to convert the screenshots when uploading the notebook. So, the markdown has the screenshots that are missing within the notebook file. The Exoplanet Transit report is the PDF file of the report I wrote with the data my team and I acquired.
